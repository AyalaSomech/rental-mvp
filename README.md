# Rental Management System – MVP

A modern web-based system for managing rental properties, tenants, contracts, and utility meters.

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) designed to create a clean, scalable foundation for a full rental property management platform.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this system is to simplify rental management by providing:
- Digital contract management
- Property and tenant organization
- Utility meter tracking (water, electricity, gas)
- Periodic meter readings (manual input + image upload)
- Usage history and tracking
- Clean and accessible user experience

This MVP focuses on building the core infrastructure and architecture that can later scale into a full SaaS product.
